4.B.1) mass = volume x density (.75) x 920 = 388 kg
energy to raise temperature = 388 x 2100 x 20 = 1.63 x10^7 J
1.4 x 10^8 or 1.4 x10^5 kJ

4.B.2) in solid state, nearest molecules cannot exchange places/have fixed positions/are closer to each other/have regular patter/have stronger forces of attractions

in liquids, bomds betweem molecules can be broken and reform
